This folder used to test the firewall on custom topologies to examine performance. <br>
First the mininet topology python script to be run followed by running xterm on hosts wished to be tested. <br>
After maikng sure the correct interface is used in the script.py file we can run the script. <br>
With rules like only allow a particular host, speed can be compared with eBPF firewall against similar rules by eBPF or TC implementation. <br>
This can be done by using iperf commands to set server at the reciever node and iperf client at the other.
